Functions used

assembly:This function calculates the score of each fragment with the other and
         and stores the score in a 2D matrix.The maximum score and its corresponding
         row and column are found.
         
assemblyProcess:Begins the loop for the greedy algorithm.Finds the maximum of the row
		and column
		
merge:The alignment of the two strings is found and merged.The resulting string is stored 
      in the row which is the maximum of the row and column found in assemblyProcess.
      Every sequence is stored in the maximum row and hence the matrix will have at the 
      end of sequencing one row with the final assembled string

changeS:Once two sequences have been merged the corresponding score matrix needs to reflect
        these changes.So a row and column has to be removed.This function does that.
        
score:This function implements dynamic programming to find the score of two strings.
      It calculates score by comparing 3 values around a matrix cell and cumulatively
      assigns a score 2 for match and -1 for a gap.
      The maximum value is found which is the score.
      
simval:Used in score.It returns 2 for match or -1 otherwise

alignment:Aligns two strings.
          The matrix is backtracked and accordingly aligned.If the maximum of the three
          cells around the current element processed lies on the diagonal it is a match.
          If it lies on the previous row a gap is inserted in the second sequence and vice
          versa if the value lies in the previous column.
          
reverse:Reverses two strings .Needed after alignment as the string obtained is in
        reverse order.
        
Max:Finds the maximum of three elements .Used in score and alignment
