This program has 5 files

tree.h has all the function prototypes ,the structure required to build the tree and
the header files stdio.h,string.h and stdlib.h

k-mer.c is the main function.Here the fragments are taken as inputs and are split into
k-mers which are as when they are computed, inserted into the binary search tree to remove 
duplicates.

tree_f.c is the file containing all tree functions.It inserts into the tree recursively
and while traversing stores the unique k-mers into a 2D array by calling function graph.

db1.c is the file in which the de bruijn graph is construted.Using the k-mers obtained
from the tree each k-mer is further split into k-1 mers.These k-1 mers are the graph nodes.
For every equivalent k-1 mer the edge represents a k-mer.
The function euler is called in this function to compute euler path.
In the same file the funtion assemble simply merges the strings based on the euler path.

euler1.c is the file in which euler path is computed using Fleury's algorithm.
The start vertex begins from that vertex  u of odd degree and using a DFS search finds the
next vertex v from u.
